The goal of the wikimapmaker project is to develop an easy-to-use map creation application for generating maps to be placed into wiki (MediaWiki) pages.

The maps are dynamic, generated with OpenLayers, and capable of pulling data from a number of external sources (with suitable licenses or public domain) such as data.gov.

In the future, the tool will also be capable of producing static maps (with Mapnik, GeoServer, or other server-side software), so that maps can be uploaded and handled on the wiki like any other image.

The ultimate goal is to have wikimapmaker deployed as a tool for Wikimedia projects, initially on the Wikimedia toolserver, and where possible, integrating features of the tool into the SlippyMap MediaWiki extension under development and slated to be deployed on Wikipedia in the next few months.
